| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “A Cloud‑native Approach for Processing of Crowdsourced GNSS Observations and Machine Learning at Scale” (CAMALIOT Case Study) | Continuous dual‑frequency carrier‑phase and pseudorange observations from a large, heterogeneous set of consumer‑grade GNSS receivers distributed worldwide. | 1. **Data Ingestion** – Observations are streamed into a cloud‑based ingestion pipeline, automatically tagged with device metadata (antenna type, firmware, GPS‑time stamp). 2. **Quality Assurance** – An automated routine applies cycle‑slip detection, ionospheric and tropospheric bias screening, and flags gross outliers based on residual statistics. 3. **Baseline‑Based Precise Positioning** – For each receiver pair a baseline is constructed; carrier‑phase ambiguities are initially treated as floats and then resolved to integers using a robust least‑squares adjustment. 4. **Machine‑Learning‑Assisted Outlier Rejection** – A lightweight neural network, trained on historical baseline residuals, flags anomalous epochs that survive the deterministic filters. 5. **Post‑Processing and Archive** – Integer‑resolved solutions are converted to epoch‑by‑epoch positions, then archived in a scalable object store for downstream geodetic analyses. 6. **Performance Monitoring** – Real‑time dashboards report root‑mean‑square errors, ambiguity success rates, and throughput, enabling continuous tuning of the pipeline. |

**Workflow Narrative**

The CAMALIOT project transforms a deluge of consumer‑grade GNSS data into high‑quality geodetic products by harnessing the elasticity of cloud computing. Once raw observations arrive at the ingestion service, they are automatically enriched with device metadata to account for varying antenna characteristics—a critical step when merging data from multiple manufacturers. The first line of defense against data contamination is a rule‑based cycle‑slip detector that operates in a sliding‑window fashion; any epoch where phase jumps exceed a threshold is flagged for exclusion. 

Ambiguity resolution is performed at the baseline level: each pair of receivers yields a single baseline solution, dramatically reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Float solutions are first computed, and integer ambiguities are fixed using the robust “LLL” algorithm, thereby enabling centimeter‑level precision even when the network is sparse. However, residual outliers can still arise from multipath or sudden attitude changes; a shallow feed‑forward network, trained on residual histograms, provides a second layer of filtering. By iteratively removing anomalous epochs, the pipeline achieves an ambiguity success rate above 95 % across the network. The final integer solutions are stored in a geodetic data lake, from which regional tectonic strain and surface deformation maps can be derived. The entire flow is monitored in real time, allowing operators to tune detection thresholds and resource allocation dynamically.

### 2. Near‑Real‑Time Earth‑Crust and Atmosphere Monitoring Service for Turkey  

| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “A GNSS‑Based Near Real‑Time Automatic Earth Crust and Atmosphere Monitoring Service for Turkey” | Continuous dual‑frequency GNSS observations from a dense national network of precision receivers; ancillary meteorological data (temperature, pressure). | 1. **Real‑Time Data Ingestion** – Raw observations are ingested into a streaming platform with a 30‑second latency. 2. **Rapid PPP / Network Solution** – A real‑time PPP pipeline runs on each receiver, yielding daily positions with 2–3 cm accuracy. 3. **Tropospheric Delay Estimation** – Zenith total delay (ZTD) is extracted from the PPP solutions and separated into wet and hydrostatic components using mapping functions. 4. **Crustal Deformation Monitoring** – Station velocities are derived from multi‑day arcs; sudden shifts are flagged if they exceed a 5‑σ threshold. 5. **Atmospheric Retrievals** – The wet component is converted to precipitable water vapor (PWV) using standard equations. 6. **Alert Generation** – Both tectonic anomalies and atmospheric outliers trigger automated alerts that are sent to the national geophysical office. 7. **Data Visualization** – A web portal displays real‑time maps of station positions, ZTD, PWV, and velocity anomalies. |

**Workflow Narrative**

The Turkish service operates as a continuous, end‑to‑end pipeline that ingests raw dual‑frequency observations from 50–70 receivers distributed across the country. The streaming architecture ensures that each epoch is processed within 30 seconds of reception, enabling near real‑time feedback. A rapid PPP engine, based on a lightweight Kalman filter, delivers daily positions with centimetric precision. From these positions the zenith total delay is extracted and then split into wet and hydrostatic components using the Niell mapping function, which accounts for local elevation and azimuth. The wet delay, after applying a conversion factor, yields PWV estimates that are plotted against local weather station data for cross‑validation.

Parallel to atmospheric monitoring, the service computes station velocities over 24‑hour arcs. If an instantaneous displacement exceeds five standard deviations relative to the long‑term velocity model, a tectonic anomaly is declared. Such an anomaly triggers a chain of automated notifications—email, SMS, and API callbacks—to the national seismic monitoring center. The web portal, built on a geospatial stack, visualizes real‑time maps of both atmospheric and crustal parameters, allowing stakeholders to assess the geodynamic state of the region in minutes rather than days. This integration of GNSS science with operational monitoring demonstrates the power of precise positioning for real‑time hazard assessment.

### 3. Forecasting Precipitable Water Vapor with Deep‑Learning‑Based GNSS Models  

| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Combined Model to Predict GNSS Precipitable Water Vapor Based on Deep Learning” | Time‑series of GNSS‑derived PWV from multiple European and Asian stations (hourly cadence over several years). | 1. **Data Harmonization** – PWV series from each station are resampled to a common temporal grid, missing values imputed via linear interpolation. 2. **Feature Engineering** – Lagged PWV values, local meteorological predictors (temperature, pressure), and seasonal indices are concatenated to form input tensors. 3. **Model Architecture** – An LSTM network with dropout regularization is trained to predict the next‑hour PWV value. 4. **Training & Validation** – A rolling‑window approach splits data into training, validation, and test sets; hyperparameters are tuned by Bayesian optimization. 5. **Error Analysis** – Root‑mean‑square error (RMSE) and bias are evaluated per station; spatial error maps highlight systematic over‑ or under‑prediction. 6. **Operational Deployment** – The trained model is packaged as a RESTful microservice that ingests live PWV streams and outputs a 24‑hour forecast. 7. **Integration with PPP** – Forecasted PWV is fed into real‑time PPP algorithms to pre‑correct wet delays, improving positioning accuracy. |

**Workflow Narrative**

The deep‑learning pipeline begins with a meticulous harmonization of raw PWV data. Because different stations sample at slightly offset times, all series are aligned to a common hourly grid and any gaps shorter than an hour are linearly interpolated. The engineered feature set incorporates not only the past PWV values (lags up to 24 h) but also contemporaneous meteorological variables such as surface temperature and atmospheric pressure, both of which influence water vapor content. Seasonal and diurnal terms are encoded as sine‑cosine pairs to capture cyclical patterns.

An LSTM network, chosen for its ability to model temporal dependencies, is trained to predict the next hour’s PWV. Dropout layers guard against over‑fitting, and a Bayesian hyper‑parameter search explores learning rates, hidden‑unit counts, and sequence lengths. After training, the model is evaluated on a hold‑out test set that preserves temporal continuity to avoid look‑ahead bias. The resulting RMSE values (typically 0.3–0.5 mm) indicate that the network captures most of the short‑term variability in PWV.

The trained network is wrapped in a lightweight container and exposed as a RESTful API. Real‑time GNSS stations send their current PWV to the service, which returns a 24‑hour forecast. By incorporating the forecast into the PPP wet‑delay model, the system can pre‑correct for expected atmospheric delays, yielding a measurable improvement in position accuracy during high‑PWV periods. This use case exemplifies how machine learning can enhance the operational utility of GNSS products.

### 4. Ocean Surface Parameter Retrieval from Spaceborne GNSS‑Reflectometry  

| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Ocean Remote Sensing Using Spaceborne GNSS‑Reflectometry: A Review” | Reflected GPS L1 carrier‑phase signals captured by a low‑orbit satellite over oceanic basins. | 1. **Signal Acquisition** – The satellite’s dual‑antenna system captures direct and reflected signals; the reflected signal is down‑converted and digitized at 20 Msps. 2. **Phase Demodulation** – A complex correlation with the GPS navigation message yields the reflected carrier phase and its amplitude. 3. **Interferometric Phase Extraction** – The phase difference between the direct and reflected paths is computed, yielding the bistatic phase. 4. **Surface Roughness Retrieval** – The bistatic phase is inverted using a physical scattering model (e.g., Kirchhoff approximation) to estimate sea‑state parameters such as significant wave height. 5. **Sea‑Surface Height Estimation** – The range delay between direct and reflected paths is converted to absolute sea‑surface height relative to the satellite orbit. 6. **Data Fusion** – Retrieved parameters are merged with SAR and altimeter products to improve spatial coverage and validation. 7. **Product Generation** – A global ocean surface height and wave height map at 10–15 km resolution is produced for climate monitoring. |

**Workflow Narrative**

Spaceborne GNSS‑reflectometry harnesses the fact that GPS satellites broadcast continuous carrier‑phase signals that, upon striking the ocean surface, are reflected back to a low‑orbit satellite. The satellite is equipped with two antennas: one pointing towards the GPS satellite (direct path) and one pointed downwards at the ocean. The reflected signal is captured at a high sampling rate (20 Msps) to preserve the rapid phase variations induced by sea‑state changes.

After digitization, a correlation process aligns the received signal with the known GPS navigation message, extracting both the amplitude and phase of the reflected carrier. Because the direct and reflected signals travel different geometric paths, a phase difference arises. By computing this bistatic phase, the algorithm obtains a sensitive measure of the ocean surface’s micro‑roughness, which can be inverted via a scattering model to retrieve significant wave height. Simultaneously, the time delay between the two signals provides the absolute distance from the satellite to the sea surface, allowing a sea‑surface height estimate.

The retrieved ocean surface products are then fused with complementary measurements from SAR and satellite altimetry to enhance spatial completeness. The final deliverable is a global ocean surface height and wave height map with 10–15 km resolution, which serves climate monitoring, navigation, and marine ecosystem studies. This use case showcases the geodetic community’s ability to repurpose GNSS signals for remote sensing of the Earth’s oceans.

### 5. Post‑Earthquake Atmospheric Response: GNSS PWV vs. Land Surface Temperature  

| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Analyzing Correlations between GNSS Retrieved Precipitable Water Vapor and Land Surface Temperature after Earthquakes” | GNSS‑derived PWV time series from regional networks; land surface temperature (LST) imagery from MODIS/VIIRS satellites, both sampled at 1 km spatial resolution and 1‑hour temporal cadence. | 1. **Spatial Co‑registration** – GNSS station PWV values are mapped to the nearest 1 km pixel; LST imagery is resampled to the same grid. 2. **Temporal Alignment** – All datasets are synchronized to a common 1‑hour time axis; gaps are filled with spline interpolation. 3. **Event‑Centered Analysis** – A 48‑hour window before and after the earthquake is extracted for each station/pixel pair. 4. **Statistical Correlation** – Pearson and Spearman coefficients are computed between PWV and LST, controlling for diurnal cycles using a harmonic regression. 5. **Spatial Pattern Detection** – Hot‑spot analysis identifies clusters of significant correlation, revealing spatially coherent atmospheric response. 6. **Physical Interpretation** – Correlations are interpreted in terms of seismic‑induced changes in ground temperature, soil moisture, and atmospheric convection. 7. **Model Validation** – Results are compared against a coupled atmosphere–ocean model that simulates post‑seismic atmospheric perturbations. |

**Workflow Narrative**

The study aims to quantify how a seismic event modulates the near‑surface atmosphere. GNSS stations provide highly accurate PWV estimates every few minutes, while satellite sensors supply LST at 1 km spatial resolution. First, the two datasets are co‑registered on a common grid: each GNSS station’s PWV is assigned to the nearest satellite pixel, ensuring that the vertical column water vapor is directly comparable to the surface temperature at that location. Temporal alignment is achieved by resampling both streams to a 1‑hour cadence; minor gaps are bridged with spline interpolation to avoid artificial discontinuities.

A 48‑hour window centered on the earthquake epoch is extracted for each location. Within this window, a harmonic regression is applied to each time series to remove the dominant diurnal cycle, isolating anomalies attributable to the seismic event. Pearson and Spearman coefficients are then computed for the residuals, providing a measure of linear and rank‑based association. To detect spatially coherent responses, a hot‑spot algorithm (e.g., Getis‑Ord Gi*) flags clusters of high correlation values. These clusters often outline the fault rupture zone and adjacent regions where ground temperature spikes due to seismic heating.

The final step involves interpreting the correlation patterns. An increase in LST coupled with a rise in PWV suggests enhanced convection and moisture transport triggered by the earthquake. The findings are compared against a regional atmospheric model that simulates post‑seismic perturbations, providing a mechanistic understanding of the observed atmospheric response. This integrative workflow demonstrates how GNSS atmospheric products can be combined with satellite remote sensing to study rapid geophysical events.
