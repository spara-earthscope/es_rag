### 1. Machine‑Learning Based Earthquake Detection  
#### The use case  
| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “A wrapper to use a machine‑learning‑based algorithm for earthquake monitoring” (Seismol. Res. Lett.) | Continuous broadband seismic waveforms from a global network of precision stations (typically 24‑h recordings sampled at 100 Hz or higher), accompanied by station metadata (location, azimuthal coverage, instrument response). | 1. **Pre‑processing** – Raw data are deconvolved to remove instrument response, high‑pass filtered to isolate P‑wave frequencies, and segmented into overlapping 4‑second windows. 2. **Feature extraction** – Each segment is transformed into a spectrogram using short‑time Fourier transforms; the resulting images are fed directly to the neural network. 3. **Model inference** – A convolutional neural network (CNN) processes the spectrograms and outputs a binary detection score for each window. 4. **Post‑processing** – Adjacent detections are merged, a confidence threshold is applied, and false positives are filtered using a simple rule‑based system (e.g., minimum event duration). 5. **Event association** – Detected windows across stations are linked through a coincidence algorithm, producing preliminary hypocentral locations and origin times. 6. **Quality control** – Automatic checks against a global catalog (e.g., USGS) flag discrepancies for manual review. 7. **Real‑time deployment** – The pipeline is wrapped in a cloud‑native workflow that streams data from an ingest queue, runs inference in containers, and pushes alerts to an event‑watching dashboard. |

The workflow emphasizes modularity: each step can be swapped for alternative algorithms (e.g., a recurrent neural network instead of a CNN) without altering the overall data flow. The result is a robust, near real‑time earthquake monitoring system that can operate on high‑volume seismic streams.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning for Time‑Lapse Seismic Monitoring  
#### The use case  
| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Unsupervised machine learning for time‑lapse seismic studies and reservoir monitoring” | Multiple 3‑D seismic surveys acquired over a hydraulic‑fracturing field (pre‑stack and post‑stack, 25 m grid spacing, 70 Hz sampling). The dataset includes raw waveforms, shot gather metadata, and well logs. | 1. **Data harmonization** – All surveys are migrated to a common reference frame, normalized for source‑receiver geometry, and amplitude‑balanced. 2. **Autoencoder training** – A stacked autoencoder learns a low‑dimensional representation of the wavefield, capturing the dominant geological structures while suppressing noise. 3. **Change‑detection** – The latent embeddings from consecutive surveys are compared using a dynamic time‑warping distance; significant deviations indicate physical changes (e.g., fracture growth). 4. **Clustering** – K‑means or spectral clustering groups similar change signatures, yielding a spatial map of evolving subsurface features. 5. **Visualization** – The clusters are projected onto 3‑D volumes and rendered in a GIS interface for geologist review. 6. **Statistical validation** – Bootstrapping the autoencoder training provides confidence intervals on change magnitudes, which are then compared with well‑log indicators (pressure, temperature). 7. **Reporting** – An automated PDF summarizing the temporal evolution of key attributes (e.g., fracture density, acoustic impedance) is generated and disseminated to stakeholders. |

By leveraging unsupervised learning, this workflow sidesteps the need for hand‑labeled training data, enabling rapid assessment of reservoir development and providing insights that would otherwise require costly manual interpretation.

### 3. Cloud‑Based Seismic Data Visualization and Analytics  
#### The use case  
| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Big seismic data visualization on cloud – a case study collaborating with industry” | Real‑time station logs, waveform snippets (mseed), event catalogs (earthquakes, tremors), and station metadata stored in an object store (S3). | 1. **Ingest** – A serverless function consumes data from an FTP/HTTP feed, parses mseed files, and writes compressed chunks to S3. 2. **Metadata cataloging** – An ElasticSearch index tracks station locations, velocity models, and active periods. 3. **Query engine** – A GraphQL interface allows users to request waveforms within time–space windows; the backend streams data from S3 and performs on‑the‑fly resampling. 4. **Visualization** – A web‑based dashboard (React + D3) renders 3‑D station networks, real‑time seismograms, and event overlays; users can zoom into a fault segment and see waveform stacks from dozens of stations. 5. **Analytics** – Built‑in Jupyter notebooks access the same data via an API, enabling advanced analyses such as ambient noise tomography or coherent‑noise attenuation. 6. **Scaling** – The entire pipeline runs on Kubernetes, with autoscaling of compute nodes based on ingest load, ensuring low latency for high‑volume events. 7. **Security & compliance** – IAM roles restrict access; data are encrypted at rest and in transit, meeting industry standards for proprietary seismic data. |

This architecture demonstrates how cloud resources can deliver interactive, high‑performance seismic analytics to a distributed team of scientists and engineers without the need for on‑premise infrastructure.

### 4. Seismic Waveform Denoising with 3‑D Convolutional Neural Networks  
#### The use case  
| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Poststack seismic data denoising based on 3‑D convolutional neural network” | Stacked seismic cubes (volume of trace amplitude, offset, time) from a marine acquisition, containing coherent shot noise, random noise, and ocean‑bottom reverberations. | 1. **Synthetic data generation** – A forward‑wave propagation model produces clean training samples; random noise and realistic oceanic noise are added to create noisy counterparts. 2. **Network architecture** – A 3‑D U‑Net is defined, with skip connections that preserve fine‑scale features while learning a global denoising mapping. 3. **Training** – The model is trained using mean‑squared error loss, with a learning rate schedule that decays after plateauing validation loss. 4. **Inference** – The trained model is applied slice‑by‑slice to the real survey, producing a denoised volume that retains subtle structural attributes. 5. **Quality assessment** – Peak signal‑to‑noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are computed against a reference clean volume (if available) or against a manual denoising benchmark. 6. **Post‑processing** – A residual filtering step removes any remaining high‑frequency artifacts, and the final volume is re‑migrated to enhance fault continuity. 7. **Deployment** – The denoising pipeline is packaged as a Docker container and scheduled to run automatically whenever a new survey is archived. |

The workflow illustrates how modern deep learning can replace labor‑intensive traditional denoising methods, producing cleaner data for subsequent interpretation.

### 5. P‑Wave Detection for Early‑Warning Applications  
#### The use case  
| Paper (excerpt) | Data Collected | Analysis Workflow |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| “Detecting P waves to enable early warning” | High‑sampling (200 Hz) broadband seismograms from a dense regional network (station spacing < 10 km), recorded continuously with GPS time stamps. | 1. **Band‑pass filtering** – A 1–20 Hz filter isolates the P‑wave band, suppressing microseismic noise. 2. **STA/LTA trigger** – A short‑time average / long‑time average algorithm runs in real time; a threshold crossing indicates a candidate event. 3. **Machine‑learning classifier** – A lightweight random‑forest model (or a small CNN) takes the raw waveform window and a set of statistical features (energy, kurtosis) to discriminate true P‑waves from noise. 4. **Event parameter estimation** – Detected P‑waves are fitted to a 3‑parameter arrival‑time model; origin time is back‑extrapolated, and hypocentral distance is estimated using a regional velocity model. 5. **Early‑warning signal** – If the estimated magnitude exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., M ≥ 4.5), an alarm is broadcast to a mobile‑app platform, accompanied by a map of the likely epicenter. 6. **Post‑alert validation** – After the S‑wave arrives, the system automatically compares the predicted magnitude with the final catalog value, updating the warning model parameters. 7. **Continuous learning** – New confirmed events are fed back into the training set to refine the classifier over time. |

This pipeline exemplifies the integration of classical seismological algorithms with modern machine‑learning classifiers to deliver rapid, actionable alerts to communities in seismically active regions.

## Integrative Commentary  

Across these five use cases, a common narrative emerges: **seismology is increasingly data‑centric, and the analytics pipelines are deliberately modular and cloud‑aware.** Data collection begins with raw seismic waveforms or derived geophysical products (e.g., velocity models, event catalogs). Pre‑processing standardizes the data, often through deconvolution, filtering, and segmentation. Feature extraction—whether through traditional spectral analysis or deep neural network embeddings—transforms raw signals into representations that are amenable to machine‑learning inference. The inference step, powered by CNNs, autoencoders, or decision trees, produces event detections, denoised wavefields, or anomaly scores. Post‑processing consolidates detections across stations, applies quality‑control heuristics, and prepares the results for visualization or alerting. Finally, the workflows are orchestrated in reproducible, containerized environments, enabling scalable deployment on-premise or in the cloud.

These practices also highlight the importance of **metadata management**. Station locations, velocity models, and survey geometry are not ancillary; they are integral to accurate detection, location, and interpretation. Moreover, the use of open‑source frameworks (e.g., ObsPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and open‑data standards (e.g., SEED, MiniSEED, GeoJSON) ensures that workflows can be shared, benchmarked, and extended by the broader community.

By documenting the data and workflows in a narrative format rather than a terse tabular summary, we provide a holistic view of how modern seismology leverages computational tools to turn raw seismic vibrations into actionable scientific knowledge.
