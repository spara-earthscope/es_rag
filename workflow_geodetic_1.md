**2. Detailed Workflow Summaries (Based on the Articles):**

*   **Article 1 (Near Real-Time Monitoring):**
    *   **Data Acquisition:** GNSS data is collected.
    *   **Data Processing:** Raw GNSS data is processed to remove noise and errors.
    *   **Earth Crust & Atmosphere Modeling:**  Models are constructed to relate GNSS observations to parameters describing changes in the Earth’s crust and atmosphere.
    *   **Prediction and Monitoring:** The models are used to predict and monitor these parameters in real-time.
*   **Article 2 (Multipath Classification):**
    *   **Data Acquisition:** GNSS data is collected, often from multiple antennas.
    *   **Signal Correlation Analysis:**  The correlation output of the GNSS signal is analyzed.
    *   **Machine Learning Classification:** Machine learning algorithms are trained to classify the different types of multipath signal based on the correlation output.
*   **Article 3 (Crowdsourced Data & ML):**
    *   **Data Collection:** Gathering GNSS observations from a distributed network of receivers.
    *   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and standardizing the data.
